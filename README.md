# 🏡 Projects Desk – End-to-End Machine Learning Projects

A collection of **practical, real-world machine learning projects in Python**.  
This repository serves as a portfolio to showcase applied ML skills, covering **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **modeling**, and **evaluation** across a variety of tasks.

Each project is designed to be **self-contained**, with clear explanations, reproducible code, and visualizations to understand both the data and model behavior.

## 📂 Projects

  - 🛠️ Comprehensive **data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering**
  - 📈 Baseline linear models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso
  - 🌳 Tree-based models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost
  - 🔄 **Cross-validation**, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection
  - 📉 Residual analysis in **log-space and dollar-space**
  - 📊 **Learning curves** to assess bias-variance trade-offs
  - 💾 Saving and loading **pipelines and models** for predictions
  - 🏆 **Final Kaggle submissions**:
    - **CatBoost (~14,578 RMSE, top ~3.8% leaderboard – best result 🎯)**
